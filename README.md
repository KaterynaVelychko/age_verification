  ## HOW IT WORKS

> - The guard at the entrance will ask a quest to show any Identity Document
> - The guard will do a Face Recognition 
> - Then, by using a special device, the guard must put the guest's exact age 
> - After the age was entered, the device will show the result

  ## PROGRAM LAUNCH 
  
> - The program will ask you to entar the age
> - You can put the numbers only (0123456789)
> - If the guest's age is 21+, the program will display a message "Welcome in!"
> - If the quest's age is under 21, the program will display a message "Underage"
> - If you put any characters besides numbers, you will see the message "Must be a number!"
